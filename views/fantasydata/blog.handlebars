        <p style='text-align:center; font-size:1.5em; margin-top:2.5%;'>Hello everybody! Welcome to DFS Analysts! This will be our first of many articles that we will publish! Our goal as DFS Analysts is to give you as much data for free as possible. We display information that many big name Daily Fantasy Sports companies charge a significant amount for! DFSAnalysts is a brand new website and we plan on adding a bunch of great features that will benefit everybody. The way we will structure our articles, is we will provide you with 2 players for each position, 1 high salary and 1 low salary. We have an 8 game slate ahead of us so lets get started!</p>

          <br>
          <p id='playerDescription'>The first player I am going to choose is Russell Westbrook. I would like to start off by saying this is going to be the fastest pace game of the day with one of best players in the league going end to end. On top of this fast pace game, the wolves are one of the worst teams at guarding the PG position.</p>
          <br>
        <h3 style="text-align:center;"><span id='playerNameStyle'>Jeremy Lin</span> - Fanduel: $ DraftKings: $</h3>
        <br>
          <p id='playerDescription'>My cheap Point Guard position of the day goes to Austin Rivers. This pick is a crap shoot because nobody is sure if Chris Paul is going to be out or not. If Chris Paul is out that will leave a ton of minutes to Austin Rivers. This game has a total gameline of 225 points and the lakers are at the bottom of the league at defensive efficiency.</p>
